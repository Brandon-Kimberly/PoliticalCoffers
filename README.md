# Political Coffers

This is my final project for CS 4620 (Database Systems) at Ohio University. It is a simple Django website that uses ChartJS to display charts and graphs
depicting federal campaign finance data. This includes things such as:
  - Top 10 campaigns by total money receipts by election year.
  - Spending ratio of the two major parties by election year.
  - Ratio of 2020 election year individual donations under and over a certain dollar amount.
  
The project is currently WIP though not being actively prioritized.
